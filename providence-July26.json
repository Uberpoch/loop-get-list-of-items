We have all learned to balance the concerns of patient safety, personal safety and delivery of care to our patients. Despite the many stressors caused by COVID-19, we have seen a few positive changes to our neurology practice at Providence. Policy changes during this pandemic have reduced barriers to telehealth access and have accelerated the practice of teleneurology in the outpatient setting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There was a precedent to remote neurologic care via telehealth prior to COVID-19: acute stroke telemedicine has been established for many years and allows our Providence stroke providers to assess and treat acute stroke patients presenting to hospitals across Oregon. Prior to COVID-19, there were positive results from clinical trials assessing patient satisfaction and outcomes in the use of telehealth for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients (Wilkinson et. al. 2016) and patients with other neurologic conditions (Hatcher-Martin et. al. 2020).</p>\n\n<p>With expansion of teleneurology services at this time, we recognize the additional benefit to patients who previously experienced challenges coming to the office, including those with significant disabilities, patients who rely on caregivers for transportation and those who live in remote areas. We have been able to assess many neurologic issues via telehealth: dementia, movement disorders, epilepsy, migraine and multiple sclerosis. We hope that the option of telehealth post-pandemic will continue to allow us to expand our practice to patients who have difficulties accessing care. Our staff in all clinics across Providence Brain and Spine Institute have been trained to assist patients with telehealth access. It has been a learning curve for all, but many find it to be a positive experience.</p>\n\n<p>We continue to offer in-person visits for procedures such as nerve testing and EMG, as well as Botox injections. In addition, we recognize some diagnoses such as ALS and other neuromuscular conditions require in-person assessment. Amidst the ongoing changes that COVID-19 has caused, we remain committed to serving patients and working with referring providers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 55, 121);\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Telehealth Helps Care for our Most Vulnerable Patients</span></span></h1>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"color: rgb(250, 150, 0);\">Julia Toub, M.D., epileptologist, Medical Director of Providence Epilepsy Center</span></em></p>\n\n<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to bring new challenges to many aspects of our lives, we understand that this time can be especially stressful for those with chronic health conditions, including our patients with seizure disorders (epilepsy). Although the pandemic has imposed many restrictions on our day-to-day activities, we at the Providence Epilepsy Center are proud to be able to continue to care for our patients with seizure disorders through telehealth.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to an in-person visit, the virtual interface facilitates the same level of interaction patients would have in a face-to-face meeting; history-taking, test-ordering, medication refills are all the same, with the added benefit of keeping patients safe at home.&nbsp; For our patients with implantable devices such as vagal nerve stimulators (VNS) and responsive neurostimulators (RNS), our doctors will determine if in-person visits are necessary. For those who face mental health challenges, our Epilepsy Psychologist is also available for virtual appointments.</p>\n\n<p>Patient safety is at the forefront of our care. Whether patients need an in-person office visit, outpatient electroencephalogram (EEG), 24 hour home EEG (ambulatory EEG), inpatient test in one of our Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) or even epilepsy surgery, we hope patients will feel more at ease knowing that we have taken extra precautions to ensure they are safe.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Wilkinson, JR et. al.

Rafe Sales, M.D. &amp; Co-Director of Providence Brain and Spine Institute&#39;s Spine Services</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Hip pain is a common and disabling condition that affects patients of all ages and that providers encounter frequently, especially in primary care settings. In one study, 14.3% of adults 60 years and older reported significant &ldquo;hip&rdquo; pain on most days during the previous six weeks. The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad, presenting a diagnostic challenge for even the most experienced clinician. Therefore having a well-established protocol to differentiate where the pain is originating can be very helpful in determining the next step in treatment.</p>\n\n<p>The first step in evaluating the patient is a thorough history. Clinicians must determine whether a patient has pain with activity, at rest, or both. Pain at night, and the presence or absence of pain-free intervals, may indicate a tumor or an infection. In general, difficulty with putting on shoes is associated with&nbsp;hip issues. A burning or electric sensation that extends to the knee or foot is more suggestive of lumbar spine&nbsp;issues, especially if accompanied by numbness or weakness. The ability of a patient to ambulate more successfully with a bent posture, a.k.a. the &ldquo;shopping cart sign,&rdquo; or improvement in pain when sitting, may indicate&nbsp;lumbar stenosis.</p>\n\n<p>In my practice, the most important question to ask relates to the location of the patient&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;hip pain.&rdquo; A patient will often express that their pain is localized to one of three regions: the anterior hip and groin, the posterior hip and buttock, or the lateral hip (Figure 1). Anterior hip and groin pain is commonly associated with intra-articular pathology of the hip itself, and allows the clinician to focus on the hip. This pain can be caused by an issue as simple as hip arthritis or as complex as a labral tear.</p>\n\n<p>Posterior hip or buttock pain typically has a greater variation of possible causes. This can be as simple as a hamstring strain or as complex as sacroiliac joint dysfunction or spinal nerve compression. Lateral hip pain occurs with greater trochanteric pain, but can also be seen with lumbar radiculopathy or a soft tissue strain.</p>\n\n<p>The second key is a thorough physical examination. Palpation for areas of tenderness over the greater trochanter, sacroiliac joints, groin, buttock, and lumbar spine may provide clues to the more likely pain generator. Pain directly over the lateral hip is almost always trochanteric bursitis, and can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications and reassurance.</p>\n\n<p>Hip&nbsp;range of motion testing should be performed, assessing for loss of rotation with pain at terminal range of motion. This is done by placing the patient supine and flexing their hip to 90 degrees, then rotating the lower leg in and out. Limited internal rotation in the presence of groin pain means the patient is 14 times more likely to have the pain arising in the hip joint. While in that same position, I will push down on the knee with significant force. If this causes pain in the back of the buttock then that could be more suggestive of sacroiliac (SI) issues.</p>\n\n<p>Positive provocative tests that likely indicate lumbar spine problems&nbsp;include the straight leg raise. If the pain radiates down the affected limb when the leg is raised off the table, it is an indicator of nerve impingement. Significant numbness or limb weakness is also suggestive of nerve compression in the spine.</p>\n\n<p>Once the history and exam are completed, the next step is based upon the clinician&rsquo;s judgment. If the clinician feels the hip is the source of the pain, a simple standing AP radiograph of the pelvis is often sufficient to identify hip arthritis. If the patient has failed to improve with significant physical therapy, then an orthopaedic surgery referral is often warranted. With the hip, sometimes an MRI-arthrogram is necessary and a standard hip MRI is not adequate; therefore, a timely referral may save the patient time and money.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if the pain is resulting from the spine or sacroiliac joint, then a standing AP and lateral lumbar radiograph is a good starting point. If the pain radiates down the leg and there is a concern for nerve compression, a standard lumbar MRI without contrast is usually sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>By utilizing these simple tools, over 95% of cases can be differentiated and the appropriate treatment provided. If there is still a question as to the source of the pain or there is a concern about a rapidly declining patient, then a referral to an orthopedic surgeon or spine surgeon can always be utilized for advanced testing and treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Figure 1: Location of Hip Pain- Anterior view left, posterior view right</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://content.cdntwrk.com/files/aHViPTc1MDg0JmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVkYjM4NjcwYjFhM2QuanBnJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9MmM5Y2M3MDM0MzFjNDY5N2FlMjg5MGZlYmFkMmE3Y2U%253D\" /></p>",

      "published": "<h1><strong><span style=\"color:#003779;\">Why Hospital-Based Rehab Is Best For Patients</span></strong></h1>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#fa9600;\"><em><strong>by Dr. Steve Andersen</strong></em></span></p>\n\n<p>How do you choose where to send your patient after their acute inpatient care, especially when there are several available options? You may already have ordered PT, OT or speech therapy in the hospital. Your patient&rsquo;s therapists might have recommended high-intensity care, an inpatient rehabilitation facility, or hospital-based inpatient rehabilitation. Among those options, it&rsquo;s not always clear which is best for your patient&rsquo;s long-term recovery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rehabilitation options for stroke patients</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stroke survivors should be treated in an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) if they qualify for it, according to the 2016 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines (Level of evidence: class I, level B).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If your patient has some level of family support at home, then a hospital-based&nbsp;rehabilitation facility &ndash; such as the Providence Acute Rehabilitation Center at Providence Portland Medical Center &ndash; often can be the best option.</p>\n\n<p>Stroke patients undergoing hospital-based IRF rehabilitation have a higher level of function, lower level of re-hospitalization, higher level of return to community and better survival than those treated in a skilled nursing facility (SNF).&nbsp;&ldquo;The studies that have compared outcomes in hospitalized stroke patients first discharged to an IRF, a SNF or a nursing home have generally shown that IRF patients have higher rates of return to community living, and greater functional recovery &hellip;&rdquo; (Weinstein, Stroke, 2016).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Where do most stroke patients actually go after their stay in the hospital? According to recent Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) data, only 22% are admitted for hospital-based IRF rehabilitation. Meanwhile, 32% are discharged to a SNF, 15% go home with home health care, and a surprising 31% receive no rehabilitation care at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The advantages of inpatient rehabilitation</strong></p>\n\n<p>IRF patients receive substantially more physical, occupational and speech therapy than SNF patients &ndash; about three hours of therapy daily at least five days a week. At the IRF,&nbsp;a physiatrist rounds daily; the rehab nurse tends to bowel, bladder, and skin disorders; and the rehab team creates and updates the treatment plan at least weekly.&nbsp;IRFs offer onsite medical services and consults,&nbsp;which are not available in SNFs,&nbsp;to support medically complex patients.</p>\n\n<p>Hospitalized patients with stroke or any other disabling illness or injury should undergo pre-admission screening for hospital-based rehabilitation. Primary care and hospital-based providers can direct the hospital care manager or social worker to refer&nbsp;for inpatient rehab, even if they aren&rsquo;t sure whether the patient will qualify. Inpatient rehab referrals also can be ordered through Epic at most Providence hospitals.&nbsp;Providers can help reduce patient anxiety by using phrases such as, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re figuring out the next step to help you recover from the stroke,&rdquo; rather than, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if you qualify for the rehab unit or the SNF.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Providence-based resources for your rehabilitation patients</strong></p>\n\n<p>For patients whom you believe would benefit best from hospital-based rehabilitation, Providence&rsquo;s IRF provides team-based care from its rehabilitation team and Providence Brain and Spine Institute.</p>\n\n<p>Providence Acute Rehabilitation Center (PARC) is an inpatient rehabilitation unit, with all private patient rooms, located on the campus of Providence Portland Medical Center and is part of Providence Brain and Spine Institute. Our physiatrist-led team includes physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, clinical psychologist, 24/7 rehabilitation nurses, and in-house medical consultants and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The most common reason for PARC admission is stroke. Average length of stay is 12-13 days, although patients with spinal cord injury or tracheostomy often stay longer. Patients who qualify for admission can continue hemodialysis or radiation therapy. PARC currently is not able to support most patients requiring ventilator support, hyperbaric oxygen treatments, chemotherapy, or surgical procedures during the actual inpatient rehabilitation stay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PARC admission process at a glance</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Clinician refers the patient via the inpatient care manager or phoning PARC admissions staff. Epic order for PPMC or PSVMC is: Inpatient consult to rehab unit (CON 337).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Admission staff and physiatrist will verify patient&rsquo;s necessity, medical stability and ability to participate in three hours of daily therapy. They also will assess family&rsquo;s ability to support discharge home.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>PARC admissions staff will work to get authorization from patient&rsquo;s health plan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Referring clinicians are encouraged to set up follow up for outpatient medical care at least two weeks after the inpatient rehab admission date.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Physiatrist will arrange home health, outpatient rehabilitation therapy referrals, and any needed medication prescriptions for the first month after inpatient rehabilitation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>How to determine what type of rehab is best for your patient</strong></p>\n\n<p>Below are some clinical indicators to help you decide what type of rehab is best for each of your patients:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>IRF</em>: Patient is stable enough to discharge from acute care; has the potential to improve; and can tolerate three hours a day of an interdisciplinary rehab approach (not just PT alone). A physiatrist visits several times weekly to manage risk factors, comorbidities and functional problems. There must be a realistic plan for return to the community after the patient completes inpatient rehab admission (rather than transfer to a SNF).</li>\n\t<li><em>SNF</em>: Physical therapy is the only requirement for recovering enough function to go home, patient has low tolerance or motivation for rehab, and it may not be feasible to return home or to another community-based setting.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><em>Home health</em>: Patient has no or very minimal post-stroke functional impairment&nbsp;on PT/OT/speech therapy evaluations. Family is able to supervise and support at home, including&nbsp;home health or outpatient rehab services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Only you know what&rsquo;s best for your individual patients, but we hope this overview and guidelines are helpful in better understanding your rehabilitation options.</p>",

That same summer, eleven children came to Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado with new, unusual symptoms: asymmetric weakness of the arms or legs, sometimes accompanied by double vision, problems swallowing, or neck weakness, with decreased reflexes in the affected limbs, and long lesions on spinal cord imaging. Four of these children tested positive for EV-D68 in respiratory secretions.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, surges in EV-D68 infections in 2016 and 2018 have been associated with increasing numbers of cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have confirmed over 500 cases of acute flaccid myelitis in the United States between 2014 and 2018, and additional cases have been reported worldwide. What do we know about this disease, and what are we doing about it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation of Acute Flaccid Myelitis</strong></p>\n\n<p>AFM occurs almost exclusively in the pediatric population, with a median age of four years, although <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://content.cdntwrk.com/files/aHViPTc1MDg0JmNtZD1pdGVtZWRpdG9yaW1hZ2UmZmlsZW5hbWU9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlXzVjNjVlZWM1OGZiODEuUE5HJnZlcnNpb249MDAwMCZzaWc9YzBhNTIwNzgwYTZkMTMxN2RlMTIyMjgwNGRhZTZmOWY%253D\" style=\"float: right; margin: 5px; width: 553px; height: 400px;\" />adult cases have been reported. There is no association with particular racial or ethnic groups, or with vaccination status.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, infections with EV-D68 and other enteroviruses cause no symptoms at all, or only mild to severe respiratory symptoms. Rarely, following a respiratory illness (or less frequently gastrointestinal symptoms), affected children develop asymmetric weakness over hours to days. The paralysis usually affects the upper extremities more than the legs, with proximal muscles more affected than distal muscles. Reflexes are decreased or absent in the weakened limbs. Cranial nerve abnormalities can include facial droop, double vision and difficulty swallowing. Usually sensation is intact, and seizures or encephalopathy are rare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Magnetic resonance imaging reveals T2-hyperintensity of the central gray matter of the spinal cord. White blood cells are usually elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid, and protein may be elevated as well. The combination of hyporeflexia, gray-matter predominant spinal cord lesions on imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid findings can confirm AFM.</p>\n\n<p>All patients diagnosed with AFM have tested negative for poliovirus, another enterovirus that can cause similar symptoms, usually with greater paralysis in the lower extremities. It can be challenging to detect an associated EV-D68 infection, due to delays in diagnosis and shedding of virus at different sites. As soon as acute flaccid myelitis is suspected, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, rectal, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens for microbiologic testing should be collected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Treatment and prognosis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The destruction of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord may be caused by an active infection, or by abnormal inflammation, provoked by infection. Treatment has focused on either modifying inflammation or inhibiting replication of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>Steroids, commonly used to suppress inflammation, have not been found to be helpful, and could potentially worsen an infection. Most patients with AFM have received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), but without controlled human trials, we do not know whether this treatment improves outcomes. Fluoxetine (Prozac) prevents Enterovirus D68 replication in vitro, but in initial studies shows no clear benefit in AFM.</p>\n\n<p>Most patients improve regardless of choice of treatment, but many have persistent weakness when they leave the hospital. With intense rehabilitation, some patients continue their recovery for over a year from disease onset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What comes next?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Physicians specializing in neurology and infectious disease, along with epidemiologists, biologists, virologists and geneticists at institutions around the country, including the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Virus Pathogen Resource, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University, Mayo Clinic, University of California at San Francisco, Columbia, Vanderbilt, University of Maryland, Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Children&rsquo;s National Hospital and Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia, are working together to predict, prevent, and treat acute flaccid myelitis.</p>\n\n<p>Two animal models have been developed to allow further testing of treatments and outcomes. A mouse model developed at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado uses neonatal mice infected intracranially, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or intranasally with contemporary strains of EV-D68. These mice then develop flaccid limb weakness (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322875\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322875</a>). Another model developed at Utah State University&rsquo;s Institute for Antiviral Research involves 10-day-old mice who are deficient in a receptor for the cytokine interferon &alpha;&beta;/&gamma;. Intraperitoneal infection of these animals leads to flaccid limb weakness as well (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5795446\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5795446</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control are collecting information and specimens on all patients with acute flaccid limb weakness, regardless of imaging or laboratory results. Clinicians should contact their state health department or the CDC directly to report all suspected cases and submit specimens for testing (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/afm-surveillance\">https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/afm-surveillance</a>).</p>",

OHSU had a second year spot open, so I interviewed in November, and started in January.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><em><strong>How did you become interested in neurology?</strong></em></span></p>\n\n<p>I was working as a family practitioner in a rural community with a limited number of neurologists.&nbsp;I was managing patients with neurologic disorders including dementia, epilepsy, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, multiple sclerosis etc. I became interest in neurology from reading about individual patient&rsquo;s problems.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><strong><em>What advice would you give someone recently diagnosed with epilepsy?</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Epilepsy, like many other neurologic disorders, is a difficult illness for patients in part because it is dynamic, not static. A day with a seizure is drastically different from a day without a seizure, and seizures are to a large extent unpredictable. There is so much fallout from even a single seizure; psychological, physical and financial.&nbsp;I advise patients to educate themselves to the greatest extent possible about epilepsy, and all its ramifications, because knowledge is power.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080;\"><em><strong>What has been the highlight of your career?</strong></em></span></p>\n\n<p>I am very excited to be joining Providence.&nbsp;There is an energy and collegiality that is unique.

I learned that sadly this was often the case for patients in Oregon. As my path led me back to Providence, I remained motivated to provide more options for patients locally in the form of clinical trials.&nbsp; Our neuro-oncology program is a clinical and research collaboration between Providence Brain &amp; Spine and Providence Cancer Institutes and encompasses multiple experts with subspecialty training who are dedicated to the management of these complex malignancies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are moving forward with translational efforts to test novel approaches in treating brain malignancies.&nbsp; Some of these approaches include tumor treating field therapy combined with chemoradiation, peptide vaccines against antigens specific to Glioblastoma along with antiangiogenic therapy, personalized medicine approach with therapies against patient derived glioma &ldquo;stem cells,&rdquo; eflornithine in anaplastic astrocytomas, and also tumor treating field therapy in newly diagnosed brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer.&nbsp; With this growing portfolio of trial options, I am happy that many patients in our community will be able to find needed treatment close to home which I believe will also improve their quality of life.</p>\n\n<p><u>METIS/EF-25</u></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\"><strong>What is the study?</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">Pivotal, open-label, randomized study of radiosurgery with or without Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) for 1-10 new brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\"><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">Patients with NEW diagnosis of Brain Metastases secondary to NSCLC.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\"><strong>Why study this?&nbsp; How does it advance the science or expand patient treatment options?</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">Prognosis for brain metastases is poor and treatment options are limited.

But that unique perspective is exactly what Ted Wilson provided after his successful recovery from a stroke in October 2020. Ted&rsquo;s remarkably lucid memory of everything from his initial symptoms to the CT scans and medication discussions among his providers, opens a window into the patient experience. Ted expressed deep gratitude for his care team and especially recalled the skillful collaboration between doctors, nurses, technicians, paramedics, and even a telestroke robot.</p>\n\n<p>Long before COVID-19 made telehealth a daily reality for many healthcare providers, stroke neurologists and emergency physicians were accustomed to connecting via telestroke for acute stroke treatment. Providence Stroke Center, a nationally recognized center of excellence for stroke care, began building a telestroke network in 2010. The network grew to over 20 hospitals around Oregon and Washington, including Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center where Ted Wilson received his life-saving stroke care.</p>\n\n<p>Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center is an accredited stroke center providing care in Corvallis, OR and surrounding areas. In 2015, Samaritan Health Services partnered with Providence to elevate stroke care across its five hospitals. This partnership gives 24/7 access to a stroke neurologist to support onsite physicians in making time-sensitive, critical stroke care decisions. Providence and Samaritan&rsquo;s partnership results in more efficient and comprehensive care, which minimizes disability as a result of stroke.</p>\n\n<p>This collaboration made all the difference for Ted on that night when his stroke began in his sleep. Still awake and reading next to him in bed, Ted&rsquo;s wife Ellen responded quickly. As she recognized the symptoms and called an ambulance, Ted awoke feeling like &ldquo;the bootup to normal consciousness was twisted and slow&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I heard and saw Ellen talking to me but could not form words in my head, let alone utter them,&rdquo; Ted recalled. &ldquo;It was scary, but Ellen&rsquo;s urgent yet calm response kept it from being terrifying.&rdquo; Ellen&rsquo;s 911 call set in motion the response that would ensure Ted&rsquo;s successful treatment and recovery. EMS notified the hospital, which prepared for Ted&rsquo;s arrival. Waiting at the door to quickly assess Ted and send him for emergent CT was Samaritan&rsquo;s stroke team including Trey Woods, D.O. and Cameron Fehr, R.N. They immediately consulted with Dr. Lisa Yanase, stroke neurologist with Providence Stroke Center, by telestroke robot.</p>\n\n<p>Ted described this digital teamwork as a &ldquo;surreal but purpose-driven scene [that] filled me with internal laughter and joy that cut through a tense personal moment.&rdquo; Fehr agreed, saying that &ldquo;the collaboration between the paramedics, nurses, emergency physician Dr. Woods and the Providence neurologist was timely and fluid. This teamwork is a nod to the efficiency and patient care we strive for every day in our stroke care. I cannot think of a better crew and team to work with.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Woods also noted the importance of patients and families who can self-advocate. &quot;The patient and his wife were able to assess the risks and benefits of the interventions offered, and they opted for treatment.&nbsp; They were both great advocates for him as well, and I think we owe that to some of the education in our community. As we know, &#39;time is brain&#39;, and this is a great example of when minutes make a difference.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud or pleased with all of the people involved.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To Ted, the team seemed &ldquo;organized, efficient, respectful and most importantly effective. This made a huge difference for me. I couldn&rsquo;t speak, but I was still in there. Internal access to language had returned, and I was bursting with questions.&rdquo; After receiving clot-busting medication, Ted improved rapidly over the next few hours. In his recovery room, a new team took over his care. &ldquo;In those moments full of restored ability, Ellen and I showered my care givers with questions and conversation. We were received with grace, patience, and answers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>According to Dr. Yanase, there has long been a national shortage of neurologists, which is why the past 10 years of telestroke implementation made a measurable difference in stroke care, improving recovery and saving lives. &ldquo;Our experience with telemedicine allowed us to support our partner providers in the sudden pivot to virtual care during COVID-19,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This shift has proven invaluable to caring for people in remote parts of our large state, and I expect that the convenience and accessibility of telehealth services will only be expanded, even as the pandemic wanes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Ted&rsquo;s story reads like a play-by-play of the ideal collaboration among healthcare professionals across hospital systems and the technological tools that connect them. It is what we might all hope to see more of in the future &ndash; life-saving collaboration born of a deadly pandemic.</p>",

Symptoms can range from reduced sensory acuity to inappropriate pain from normal sensory stimuli and may also include tingling or painful sensations such as burning, prickling, or electrical shooting pains.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately the prevalence of polyneuropathy continues to increase due to increased incidence of medical conditions which cause polyneuropathy in addition to age-related (senescent) polyneuropathy in the aging population. Therefore it is understandable that the number of patients in primary care clinics with polyneuropathy is increasing. This often triggers a question about whether a particular patient with neuropathy should be seen by a neurologist. This question takes on greater significance in the setting of increased attention to costs of care and increased wait times for specialty appointments.</p>\n\n<p>The high yield evaluation for causes of neuropathy is relatively straight forward: diabetic screening, alcohol-abuse screening, thyroid function testing, B12 and methylmalonic acid levels, and an evaluation for monoclonal gammopathy with serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IFE). Of course diabetes and pre-diabetes are the most common causes of polyneuropathy in the U.S. and most of these patients never need to see a neurologist or have an electrodiagnostic study (AKA EMG/nerve conduction study).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately even after thorough and extensive testing the cause of many patients&rsquo; neuropathy remains undefined and is labeled as &ldquo;idiopathic.&rdquo; This can be 30-50 percent of polyneuropathies depending on the population studied. A portion of these patients may have a hereditary cause and others may have senescent polyneuropathy. The good news is that most patients with idiopathic polyneuropathies have generally benign clinical courses and their conditions are often described as &ldquo;nuisance neuropathies&rdquo;. Treatment focuses on symptomatic management of neuropathic pain when the pain interferes with sleep or routine activities.</p>\n\n<p>What clinical features prompt additional concern and warrant specialty consultation? There are a few features which should be considered &ldquo;red flags&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rapid onset:</strong> Most neuropathies have an indolently progressive course. One that escalates quickly in severity or anatomical distribution over a period of just weeks to a couple of months deserves additional work up even if the initial evaluation is normal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early weakness:</strong> Nuisance neuropathies are primarily sensory, distal, and without weakness. Patients will complain of paresthesias or dysesthesias of the toes or distal feet but strength remains intact. Watching a patient walk and having them elevate on toes and heels is a high yield exam technique which compliments direct muscle strength testing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asymmetric or proximal weakness:</strong> It is rare for a routine neuropathy to cause unilateral, asymmetric (e.g. foot drop and contralateral wrist drop), proximal weakness, or cranial nerve involvement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early severe pain:</strong> The dysesthesias, hyperpathia and allodynia of neuropathy are the primary reasons that patients seek medical attention and these symptoms will progress over time. However severe pain from the onset is unexpected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early gait imbalance: </strong>Impairment of proprioception in neuropathy can contribute to gait imbalance and falls and is particularly problematic in older individuals who have additional reasons for poor balance such as deconditioning, joint pain, loss of visual acuity and presbyastasis. However imbalance and other forms of incoordination are unexpected initial manifestations of neuropathy in an individual without such risk factors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Monoclonal gammopathy:</strong> Monoclonal gammopathies are relatively common and increase in prevalence in those over 50 years old. Most of these are monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) and some of these patients will also develop an unrelated polyneuropathy. However the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy in a person with polyneuropathy warrants additional attention as this could indicate an autoimmune etiology.</p>\n\n<p>The approach to a patient with polyneuropathy can be initially daunting, however by focusing on the high yield evaluation for causes of neuropathy, treating neuropathic pain when it becomes problematic, and pursuing specialty consultation when encountering red flags, patients will receive evidence-based, appropriate and high quality care.</p>",

The goal of the program is to help consumers find both quality and value for their specialty care needs, while encouraging healthcare professionals to improve the overall quality and delivery of care nationwide, and providing a credible foundation for local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans (Blue Plans) to design benefits tailored to meet employers&rsquo; own quality and cost objectives.</p>\n\n<p><em><small>Blue Distinction Centers (BDC) met overall quality measures, developed with input from the medical community. A Local Blue Plan may require additional criteria for providers located in its own service area; for details, contact your Local Blue Plan. Blue Distinction Centers+ (BDC+) also met cost measures that address consumers&rsquo; need for affordable healthcare. Each provider&rsquo;s cost of care is evaluated using data from its Local Blue Plan. Providers in CA, ID, NY, PA, and WA may lie in two Local Blue Plans&rsquo; areas, resulting in two evaluations for cost of care; and their own Local Blue Plans decide whether one or both cost of care evaluation(s) must meet BDC+ national criteria. National criteria for BDC and BDC+ are displayed on www.bcbs.com. Individual outcomes may vary. For details on a provider&rsquo;s in-network status or your own policy&rsquo;s coverage, contact your Local Blue Plan and ask your provider before making an appointment. Neither Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association nor any Blue Plans are responsible for non-covered charges or other losses or damages resulting from Blue Distinction or other provider finder information or care received from Blue Distinction or other providers.</small></em></p>",

Despite significant strides,&nbsp;​complication rates remain significant. Other fields, such as cardiac surgery, have developed guidelines and protocols that have led to significant improvements in this area. There has been strong interest in applying such principles of risk stratification to adult spinal deformity surgery, particularly over the last 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the strong interest and multiple publications on complication avoidance, there have been only three initiatives well published in the literature. While these initiatives have shown a decrease in complication rates, there remains much to be addressed. There is no doubt that using a uniform approach with some standardization that allows for individualization of surgery has led to improvements in our field as it has in others.</p>\n\n<p>Spinal Deformities treated include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Scoliosis</li>\n\t<li>Kyphosis</li>\n\t<li>Spondylolisthesis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other complex problems include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tumors</li>\n\t<li>Previous procedures</li>\n\t<li>Congenital abnormalities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We have worked on a complex spine protocol to apply some of these principles to our patient population here in Portland. Our initiative includes three arms: preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods.</p>\n\n<p>The preoperative arm begins with a clinic visit when a patient is identified as appropriate for the protocol and entered into it. The surgeon and assigned nurse review the patient&rsquo;s history and physical and supporting data and then enter it on to our data sheet.&nbsp; We affectionately call it, our checklist. The surgeon proposes a procedure to correct the patients&rsquo; issues and depending on the complexity of the procedure and the patient&rsquo;s medical history, the different areas are filled in. These areas include, but are not limited to, planned procedure, ASA score, labs, opioid use, and outcomes measures. The patient is then presented at a multidisciplinary conference attended by surgeons, nurses, PM&amp;R, anesthesia, nutrition and other providers. The appropriateness of the patient and the surgery is reviewed. Decisions are made on how to move forward such as proceeding with surgery, additional work up, or choosing not to proceed.</p>\n\n<p>If the patient is deemed appropriate for surgery, preparations are made, and we proceed with the intraoperative portion of our protocol.</p>\n\n<p>An intraoperative checklist, just as with the preoperative portion, is utilized in order to minimize complications and improve outcomes. Considerations include blood loss, infection, pain, blood pressure control, neuromonitoring, spinal navigation, positioning, embolism precautions, glucose control and graft considerations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The post-operative phase begins as soon as the patient is taken out of the operating room. A protocol detailing key parameters and goals for neurosurgery patients is reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>The ICU team is consulted and sign out is given. Special attention is given to hemodynamic and neurological stability, pain control, hematocrit and glucose. Appropriate imaging is obtained. Additional attention is given for significant blood loss, CSF leak and neurological compromise.&nbsp; Mobilization commences as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the hospitalization, the patient is mobilized with Physical and Occupational therapy; the Foley catheter is discontinued; oral intake is progressed; pain control is addressed. If the hospitalization is extended due to complication or other factors, appropriate tests (e.g.: LE duplex, labs) are ordered to avoid complications.</p>\n\n<p>Once discharged, patients are usually followed 1-2 years with outcomes questionnaires completed (ODI, NDI, SRS-22) to track progress. We are in the process of tabulating our progress to better understand how we can improve. We look forward to fully implementing it in the near future.</p>\n</div>",

They have taught me to appreciate the subtleties of life and have a greater appreciation for friends, family and colleagues.</p>",

Oliveria, M.D., Ph.D.</span></em></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"color: rgb(250, 150, 0);\">Medical&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style=\"color: rgb(250, 150, 0);\">Director, Functional Neurosurgery, Providence Brain and Spine Institute</span></em></p>\n\n<p>Stereotactic laser ablation, also known as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), is a minimally-invasive neurosurgical technique that expands treatment options for patients with brain tumors. Fiber optic laser probes are precisely implanted in the brain to ablate tumors using heat generated by high intensity light at the tip of the laser fiber. Heat-sensitive, real-time MRI thermography is used for guidance during the procedure to monitor damage to the tumor, while protecting nearby brain tissue. Brain tumors can be treated with LITT via a 3 mm skull opening and similarly sized skin incision. This eliminates the need for a traditional open craniotomy. Most patients are observed overnight and discharged the next morning after the procedure with minimal discomfort. At Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, we use state of the art stereotaxy&mdash;typically including dual intraoperative CT and MR imaging performed in the same operating room without moving the patient&mdash;to maximize the safety and efficacy of the procedure.</p>\n\n<p>LITT has several applications in surgical neuro-oncology. First, this technique is particularly useful for deeply located tumors where open resection carries high risk to surrounding brain structures, or as a second stage after open surgical debulking to reach residual tumor that could not be removed safely via an open approach. Second, it can be combined with stereotactic biopsy to diagnose and provide focal control at the earliest sign of recurrence for malignant brain tumors including glioblastoma. For malignant tumors, LITT is performed palliatively but has similar cytoreductive benefit to open re-resection with more rapid recovery and reduced surgical risk. Finally, LITT can also be used for patients with metastatic brain tumors that grow after radiation therapy and/or develop treatment-related radiation necrosis. In this clinical situation, LITT can help to reduce steroid-dependence for patients with persistent cerebral edema. Also, interruption of systemic chemotherapy treatment is greatly reduced compared to open craniotomy, since wound healing complications are much less of a concern.</p>\n\n<p>LITT is generally limited to small tumors with relatively simple geometry: the laser probes create a sphere of tissue ablation with a maximal diameter of 2 cm. By retracting the catheters, cylindrical ablations can be achieved and multiple stereotactic trajectories can be combined to create complex shapes within the confines of the surrounding brain anatomy. Additionally, since the ablation is performed within the strong magnetic field of an MRI scanner, neither standard intraoperative neuromonitoring nor awake neurologic testing can be readily performed to monitor eloquent brain function during the procedure. Despite these limitations, LITT is a promising innovation that not only improves surgical safety, efficacy and comfort, but also represents a new approach to treat tumors that were previously considered surgically inaccessible.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: Medtronic Visualase</p>",

A discussion of risks can be intimidating enough, but is also often overshadowed by advice from friends, relatives and co-workers, much of which may not be applicable. Spine surgery sounds monolithic, but may be done for spinal cord or nerve root compression, mechanical instability, sagittal or coronal imbalance (the S curve of scoliosis or the forward bend of Kyphosis), infection, tumor or disc degeneration. Canal or foraminal stenosis can come from bone spurs, disc herniation, epidural lipomatosis, spondylolisthesis, infection or tumor. So not every patient is having surgery for the same reason or combination of reasons, and that can be difficult to communicate.</p>\n\n<p>The same applies to the safety of surgery. While some surgeries may be more risky than others, some patients have inherently higher risks. Uncontrolled diabetes (HgA1c &gt;= 8), obesity (BMI &gt;=40, or in some cases as low as 30), malnutrition, heart disease, lung disease, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, uncontrolled hypertension, opioid use and other factors can all influence surgical outcome - both complication rate and PRO (patient reported outcome).</p>\n\n<p>Risk stratification begins with a visit to the pre-op anesthesia clinic where a comprehensive evaluation of a patient&rsquo;s surgical risks is performed. After a history and exam, speaking to other involved physicians (cardiology, oncology, primary care, etc.) and assessing co-morbidities, the clinic makes recommendations on peri-operative management. The recommendations are relayed to the surgeon, discussed with the patient at the visit and sent out to any other involved physicians.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to other needed labs, a nasal swab is done to look for MSSA or MRSA causing nasal colonization. Staph nasal colonization carries a significantly increased risk of getting a surgical site infection. If infection is found, nasal mupiricin may be prescribed ahead of surgery, or a nasal treatment done the day of surgery (nose to toes protocol) in addition to the Ancef or Vancomycin (in case of PCN anaphylaxsis).</p>\n\n<p>If sleep apnea is a concern, care is taken to ensure that patients are stable on their CPAP as sleep apnea can be exacerbated perioperatively, especially in the setting of narcotic use and/or obesity. Recommendations for safe weight loss can also be given as decreasing BMI helps surgical exposure, decreases risk of infection and helps overall health.</p>\n\n<p>Once patients are screened for&nbsp;elective surgery the procedure is scheduled (this process is truncated in the setting of urgent surgery such as cervical myelopathy), Patients are frequently overwhelmed with the detail involved in pre- and peri-op management. They often fail to remember important issues such as when to stop NSAIDs or other meds. At Providence, we are using Twistle in an effort to help streamline this process for patients.</p>\n\n<p>Twistle provides patient engagement and secure messaging via a phone app to help patients prepare for surgery. A seven, 14, or 30 day&nbsp;protocol can be used, depending on what the surgeon&rsquo;s office assigns as the appropriate protocol. Twistle will then send appropriate reminders about pre-op medications, showering, activity restrictions and advice and FAQ tailored to the individual. Additional options include appointment reminders, links to informational videos, and the ability for the patient to send in photos of the incision, in case of concern. Taken together, peri-op optimization and the enhanced communication and information provided by Twistle help to make surgery as safe and stress-free as possible.</p>",

      "published": "<h1><span style=\"color:#003779;\"><strong>Clinical Assessment of the Tremor Patient</strong></span></h1>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"color:#fa9600;\">Elise Anderson, M.D., neurologist, Providence Neurological Specialties-East</span></em></p>\n\n<p>Tremor is a common reason for referral to neurology. Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic movement that can affect the head, arms and legs; rarely the trunk can be involved. Diagnosis of the cause of a tremor is almost always based on two types of information: the history provided by the patient and our exam in-clinic.&nbsp; Labs and imaging scans rarely lead us to the diagnosis, though this type of information can be crucial in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the in-clinic visit, there are a few clues about the patient from his or her chart. A younger patient will be more likely to have essential tremor (ET) or an enhanced physiologic tremor. Patients in their 60s are at greater risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). A patient with an acute, severe tremor is more likely to have a brain insult, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, and I might be seeing that patient in the emergency room rather than in a clinic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In-clinic, I&rsquo;ll want to know how long the tremor has been present and if one side is worse than the other. How bothersome is the tremor, and if it is a hand or arm tremor, is it worse with activity or at rest? Is it amplified by stress or fatigue? Does the tremor imp<span style=\"color:#000000;\">rove after alcohol? </span><a><span style=\"color:#000000;\">It turns out that most tremors get worse with stress, and in some cases stress management is the most effective treatment for tremor. Most tremors subside with alcohol &ndash; patients with ET can find it especially effective&nbsp;&ndash; but alcohol use is not a recommended treatment.</span></a></p>\n\n<p>Medication history is significant. Antipsychotics and nausea medications that block dopamine receptors can cause a clinical picture that looks just like PD, while some pain meds and serotonergic antidepressants can produce myoclonus.</p>\n\n<p>When I examine a tremor patient, I will use a distraction technique so that the tremor emerges more naturally, such as reciting the months of the year backwards. I&rsquo;ll be looking at the amplitude and frequency of the tremor, and if it is more prominent with activity or at rest. A high-amplitude, symmetric tremor that emerges with activity, like eating or drinking, is usually ET &ndash; this can affect the head as well, and sometimes the legs. An asymmetric, lower-frequency tremor that is more prominent at rest and improves with activity suggests PD. A tremor that only affects the head, especially a jerky or &ldquo;bobble head&rdquo; tremor, is typical for cervical dystonia. A fine, fast, symmetric tremor is seen in enhanced physiologic tremor and with lithium therapy.</p>\n\n<p>A few low-tech clinical tests can be helpful. A tremor that is at its worst when sipping from a cup favors essential tremor, while a tremor that is most prominent during a gait exam favors<a> P</a>D.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll often ask patients for a writing sample. A tremor that is seen only with writing can be a more rare form of dystonic tremor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In some cases additional testing is needed &ndash; possibly a TSH screen for hyperthyroidism, or ceruloplasmin testing in a younger patient with a Parkinsonian picture concerning for Wilson&rsquo;s disease. We&rsquo;ll want to rule out stroke in acute tremor cases, and if a patient with suspected PD does not respond to medication, we&rsquo;ll often obtain an MRI to look for findings to suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as vascular Parkinsonism. A DaTscan is a type of SPECT scan that can be used to distinguish between ET and Parkinsonism.</p>\n\n<p>Management of tremor is a topic for another day. However, I&rsquo;ll note that a robust response to levodopa confirms the diagnosis of PD in a patient with typical symptoms, and this is an important part of the screening process when we consider deep brain stimulation (DBS) for our PD patients. We have a number of medication options for the different types of tremor reviewed above, as well as botulinum toxin injections, which can be very helpful in cervical dystonia. Finally, we can offer DBS, Gamma Knife and ultrasound thalamotomy to some patients with medication refractory tremors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ref:</p>\n\n<p>Sharma S, Paney S: Approach to a tremor patient. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5144461/?report=classic\">Ann Indian Acad Neurol</a>. 2016 Oct-Dec; 19(4): 433&ndash;443.</p>\n\n<p>Botzel K, Tronnier V, Gasser T: The Differential Diagnosis and Treatment of Tremor.&nbsp; <u>Dtsch Arztebl Int. </u>2014 Mar; 111(13): 225-236.</p>",
